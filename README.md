## Overview
Stream Assistant is a web application tailored to the needs of Twitch streamers. Its primary goal is to offer streamers a comprehensive toolkit for enhancing their interaction with viewers. By seamlessly integrating video and chat feeds from the Twitch channel, Stream Assistant introduces three distinct features:

**Real-time Word Cloud and Emoji Insights:** Streamers can access a real-time word cloud of the most frequently used words in the chat. Additionally, the application provides a top emoji report, showcasing the most popular emojis employed by viewers.
    
**Efficient Polling System:** Simplify the polling process with an automated system that tracks and displays statistical information on chat message content. Streamers can add custom answers to tailor polls to their needs, allowing for more engaging and informed interactions. Stream Assistant enables streamers to verbally pose questions, with answers displayed as real-time statistics. This feature enables seamless communication and encourages increased audience participation.

Stream Assistant is the result of an effort as part of a master's thesis study. The application's development was driven by the desire to explore and validate the effectiveness of real-time summarization techniques in improving communication between streamers and viewers.
